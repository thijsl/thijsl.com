# OTT news at Google I/O 2022

_I watched Google I/O 2022 so you don't have to! Below are crisp summaries of what Google has in store for us on Google TV, Android TV, Android Media and ExoPlayer._

Google I/O is Google's yearly developer conference. If you're a video streaming enthusiast, I'd recommend you to spend 30 minutes watching the presentations on "[What's new with Android TV and Google TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZTOaKFnNTw)" and "[What's new in Android media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba70zmFZgk0)". If you can spare two hours, you could watch the [keynote](https://io.google/2022/program/8e80903f-955f-4a5b-9118-b0ce4acdb0e6/) ‚Äì or skim a [recap](https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/11/23066583/google-io-2022-biggest-announcements-pixel-watch-6a-buds-tablet).

The next two sections outline these first two presentations. Click the timecode in "the timeline" (below the video) to be taken to that part of the presentation. (_You might need to click the Play-button again on some devices to resume video playback._)

const spans = document.querySelectorAll('.post-content ul li span'); for (let i = 0; i < spans.length; i++) { const span = spans\[i\]; const videoId = parseInt(span.parentElement.parentElement.dataset.videoid); const youtubeId = (videoId == 0) ?
